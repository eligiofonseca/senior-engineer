          Hello, I'm <a href="./contactme.html">Eligio Fonseca</a>, a seasoned
          Quality Engineer based in Los Angeles. With over a decade of
          experience in testing web and desktop applications, I am deeply
          passionate about leveraging technology to enhance the field of
          software testing. My focus primarily revolves around consumer-facing
          products, where I strive to contribute to the continuous improvement
          of software quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my previous role as a Senior Quality Automation Engineer at Red
          Ventures, I specialized in manual QA, acceptance testing, and
          regression testing. I also delved into UI/UX automation for prominent
          platforms such as CNET.com, Metacritic, TVGuide, and more. This
          experience allowed me to significantly reduce incident reporting and
          contribute to a notable decrease in software defects.
        </p>
        <p>
          My expertise lies in creating and maintaining comprehensive test
          plans, fostering close collaboration with cross-functional teams to
          ensure seamless communication and resolution of quality issues. From
          automating front-end/back-end services at ViacomCBS to playing a
          crucial role in the successful acquisition of Clicked Media Inc. by
          CBS Interactive, I have consistently demonstrated my commitment to
          excellence and adaptability to various software development workflows.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am on a continuous learning path, exploring how AI models can
          revolutionize testing processes, improve efficiency, and elevate the
          overall quality of software products. This dedication to staying at
          the forefront of technological advancements allows me to bring
          innovative solutions to the projects I undertake. My commitment to
          excellence, adaptability, and dedication to creating high-quality
          software products make me a valuable asset to any team. Let's connect
          and explore how my skills and experiences can contribute to the
          success of your projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside the realm of QA, I'm an enthusiast of long-distance running,
          having completed three marathons in LA and NYC. Additionally, I find
          joy in cycling and have successfully completed two 50-mile bicycle
          races in Baja California, Northern Mexico. These pursuits not only
          contribute to my physical well-being but also enhance my resilience,
          discipline, and focusâ€”qualities that seamlessly align with the demands
          of the tech industry.
