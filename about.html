            <p class='introP'>Hello, I'm <a href='./contactme.html'>Eligio Fonseca</a>, a seasoned quality engineer with
                a passion for leveraging
                technology to enhance the world of software testing. Currently based in Los Angeles, I bring over ten
                years of experience testing web and desktop applications, with a focus on consumer-facing products. I am
                on a
                continuous learning path, discovering how AI models can revolutionize testing processes, improve
                efficiency, and contribute to the overall quality of software products. </p>
            <p>
                In a previous role as a Senior Quality Automation Engineer at Red Ventures, I specialized in manual QA,
                acceptance testing, and regression testing, with some UI/UX automation for prominent platforms like
                CNET.com, Metacritic, TVGuide, and various others, reducing incident reporting and contributing to a
                significant decrease in software defects. </p>
            <p>
                With a knack for creating and maintaining comprehensive test plans, I have collaborated closely with
                cross-functional teams to ensure seamless communication and resolution of quality issues. My experience
                spans diverse projects, from automating front-end/back-end services at ViacomCBS to contributing to the
                successful acquisition of Clicked Media Inc. by CBS Interactive. My commitment to excellence,
                adaptability to various software development workflows, and dedication to creating high-quality software
                products make me a valuable asset to any team. </p>
            <p>
                Outside the realm of QA, I'm an enthusiast of long-distance running, having completed three marathons
                (LA/NYC). I also especially enjoy riding my various bicycles, having completed two 50-mile bicycle races
                in Baja California, Northern Mexico.</p>
